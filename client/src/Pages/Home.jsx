        <p className='text-slate-600 font-semibold p-3'>Yuta is a young man with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. As a first-year, Yuta's body language made it obvious that he was under a lot of stress. His posture was very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his eyelids from a lack of sleep. As a second-year student, Yuta's hair has grown longer and he wears it in a more relaxed style instead of a spiky one.

        Yuta was a very timid and lonely boy who was bullied a lot while growing up. Due to Rika haunting much of his early life, Yuta was unable to connect with other people and has lost all confidence in himself. This makes it difficult for Yuta to interact with others, as they often scare him without meaning to, or he's just too shy to speak to them.
